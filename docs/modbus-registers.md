## 1 Introduction

The NeoPool / Vistapool Control System is equipped with RS485 communication ports using a MODBUS protocol that allows a remote controller to adjust the different working parameters of the device. The 2015 spec mentions two such ports; the 2023 v10.23 spec lists three.

The first port, labelled on the board as **"DISPLAY"**, is usually connected to the Screen Controller, which is itself a MODBUS master. The other port, labelled as **"RF/WIFI"**, is available for external communications.

A semaphore system has been implemented between all ports in order to manage register change requests happening simultaneously in both ports. However, the remote masters can always read any register concurrently.

The slave has the **MODBUS address 1** as default communication address, but it can be changed with a reserved procedure (see [`MBF_NODE_ADDR`](#register-0x0000---mbf_node_addr)).

**Communication parameters for the RS485 asynchronous serial port:**

| Parameter | Value       |
| --------- | ----------- |
| Baud rate | 19200 bauds |
| Parity    | None        |
| Stop bits | 1           |

> **Warning:** The alteration of registers other than the ones described in this document could lead to a bad operation of the system, and in some cases, to an unrecoverable failure requiring technical assistance.

## 2.1 Modbus Page (MODBUS)

### Register 0x0000 - `MBF_NODE_ADDR`

_Documented in 2023 v10.23 (Hayward / Vistapool); not present in 2015 NeoPool spec._

This register contains the current MODBUS slave address. Writing to this register changes the MODBUS address of the node.

The value of this register must be in the range of 1 to 240, both inclusive. Address 0 is reserved for sending broadcast messages to all devices.

When a write to this register occurs, the system must complete the write transaction by sending the response message, and only after that perform the change of the MODBUS address.

---

## 2.2 Measures Page (MEASURE)

### Register 0x0100 - `MBF_ION_CURRENT`

Current measured in the ionization system. The value is obtained from the microcontroller ADC and corrected using the calibration data:

- `MBF_PAR_ION_NOM`: Maximum ionization current
- `MBF_PAR_ION_CAL0`: ADC value measured at idle state
- `MBF_PAR_ION_CAL1`: ADC value measured at maximum ionization current

Formula: `MBF_ION_CURRENT = (adcValue - MBF_PAR_ION_CAL0) / (MBF_PAR_ION_CAL1 - MBF_PAR_ION_CAL0) * MBF_PAR_ION_NOM`

---

### Register 0x0101 - `MBF_HIDRO_CURRENT`

Current working level measured in the hydrolysis/electrolysis system.

Formula: `MBF_HIDRO_CURRENT = (hidroAdcValue - MBF_PAR_HIDRO_CAL0) / (MBF_PAR_HIDRO_CAL1 - MBF_PAR_HIDRO_CAL0) * MBF_PAR_HIDRO_NOM`

---

### Register 0x0102 - `MBF_MEASURE_PH`

pH level measured in hundredths. A value of 700 means pH 7.00.

This register is only valid if the pH module is enabled. Check `MBF_PH_STATUS` for the module status.

---

### Register 0x0103 - `MBF_MEASURE_RX`

Redox/ORP level measured in hundredths of ppm. A value of 100 means 1.00 ppm.

### Registers 0x0206-0x0207 - `MBF_PAR_HIDRO_WORK_TIME_LOW` and `MBF_PAR_HIDRO_WORK_TIME_HIGH`

_Documented in 2023 v10.23 (Hayward / Vistapool); not present in 2015 NeoPool spec._

This set of two registers contains the number of seconds that the chlorination cell has been working since the device was manufactured. The two registers must be read consecutively to build a 32-bit unsigned integer with the time.

This counter must not be erased as it is used to estimate the lifetime of the device.

---

### Registers 0x0208-0x0209 - `MBF_PAR_PARTIAL_HIDRO_WORK_TIME_LOW` and `MBF_PAR_PARTIAL_HIDRO_WORK_TIME_HIGH`

_Documented in 2023 v10.23 (Hayward / Vistapool); not present in 2015 NeoPool spec._

This set of two registers contains the number of seconds that the chlorination cell has been working since the counter was reset (partial counter). The two registers must be read consecutively to build a 32-bit unsigned integer with the time.

This counter is reset each time the cell is changed by the installer and it is used to estimate the total working time of a cell.

---

### Register 0x02F0 - `MBF_SAVE_TO_EEPROM`

Writing the value 1 to this register immediately starts an EEPROM storage operation. During the EEPROM storage procedure, the system may be unresponsive to MODBUS requests. The operation will always last less than 1 second.

EEPROM write operations occur automatically every 10 minutes. However, after modifying a MODBUS configuration register it is recommended to force a write operation, as this is the only safe way to preserve the information if the box is switched off before the periodic EEPROM write automatically occurs.

> **Warning:** The number of EEPROM write operations is guaranteed to be 100,000 cycles. Once this number is exceeded, safe storage of information cannot be guaranteed.

---

### Register 0x02F1 - `MBF_CLEAR_EEPROM`

_Documented in 2023 v10.23 (Hayward / Vistapool); not present in 2015 NeoPool spec._

A write operation to this register (with any value) restores the register memory to its factory default state immediately. This operation does **not** store the values into non-volatile EEPROM memory. To store the contents of the factory default state, a `MBF_SAVE_TO_EEPROM` operation has to be executed.

---

### Register 0x02F2 - `MBF_RESET_USER_COUNTERS`

_Documented in 2023 v10.23 (Hayward / Vistapool); not present in 2015 NeoPool spec._

- `MBF_PAR_PARTIAL_HIDRO_WORK_TIME`
- `MBF_PAR_PARTIAL_ION_WORK_TIME`
- `MBF_PAR_PARTIAL_UV_WORK_TIME`

These counters are associated with the user-level access.

This operation does **not** store the values into non-volatile EEPROM memory. To store the contents of the factory default state, a `MBF_SAVE_TO_EEPROM` operation has to be executed.

---

### Register 0x02F4 - `MBF_STOP_ALL_MODULES`

_Documented in 2023 v10.23 (Hayward / Vistapool); not present in 2015 NeoPool spec._

**Mode 0: MANUAL**

This mode allows the filtration to be switched on and off manually. No timers or additional functions are involved. The state is controlled via `MBF_PAR_FILT_MANUAL_STATE`.

**Mode 1: AUTO (timed)**

Filtration is switched on according to timers. The timers allow setting start and end times for filtration. Timers always operate on a daily basis.

**Mode 2: HEATING (timed with optional climate control)**

Works like AUTO mode but also includes a relay that is activated or deactivated based on water temperature. The setpoint temperature is configured in this mode, and the system uses a 1-degree hysteresis.

Additionally, there is an optional "climate control" (shown on screen as "CLIMA" on/off). This option keeps the filtration running after its scheduled period if the temperature is below the setpoint. When the setpoint is reached, filtration stops and does not restart until the next scheduled period.

Example of hysteresis: if the setpoint is 23 °C, the system activates when temperature drops below 22 °C and stops when it exceeds 23 °C.

> Note: This mode is only visible when the temperature sensor option is active and heating is enabled.

**Mode 3: SMART**

Based on the AUTO/timed mode, but adjusts filtration times based on temperature. Two temperature parameters are provided: the maximum temperature (at which filtration times follow the configured timers) and the minimum temperature (at which filtration is reduced to 5 minutes, the minimum working time). Filtration times scale linearly between these two temperatures.

Additionally there is an optional anti-freeze mode, which keeps filtration on if the system temperature is below 2 °C.

> Note: This mode is only visible when the temperature sensor option is active.

**Mode 4: INTELLIGENT**

The most complex filtration mode. It involves both temperature and heating.

The user has two working parameters:

- Desired temperature
- Minimum filtration time (minimum 2 hours, maximum 24 hours) = Tfilt

Operation:

- The system starts filtration every 2 hours.
- The minimum filtration time is divided into 12 segments (Tfon = Tfilt/12).
- A variable Tbonus = Tfilt - 2 hours is created.
- After 10 minutes, Tbonus starts counting down. When Tbonus is exhausted, filtration stops.
- After Tfon, the temperature is measured (the first 10 minutes ensure sufficient water flow). If the temperature is at or above the setpoint, filtration stops.
- If the temperature is below the setpoint, filtration continues and the time is deducted from Tbonus.
- Filtration runs a minimum of 10 minutes every 2 hours to check temperature. So the minimum filtration in intelligent mode is 2 hours per day (10 min × 12 times).

Example: with 10 hours minimum filtration time: 10h × 60min / 12 = 50 minutes per 2-hour interval. Of those 50 minutes, 10 are mandatory and 40 are used when heating is needed.

> Note: This mode is only visible when the temperature sensor option is active.
